                    For a career in software development, we will need a solid foundation in programming languages.
                    <br>
                 <ul>
    
                    <li> HTML/CSS: HTML is a markup language, and CSS is the style sheet language used to present the information written in HTML. Together, HTML and CSS create the look of web pages.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript: JavaScript is a high-level programming language conforming to the ECMAScript specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it ranks among the three core technologies of the internet.</li>
                    <li>C#: This general-purpose programming language comprises functional, declarative, object-oriented, component-oriented, and generic programming disciplines</li>
                    <li>Python: Python is an interpreted, general-purpose, high-level programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability by using significant whitespace and providing clear programming on large and small scales</li>
